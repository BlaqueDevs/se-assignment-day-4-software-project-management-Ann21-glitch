## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Answer:

 Agile vs. Waterfall
 
Agile methodology takes a flexible, iterative approach while Waterfall methodology takes a linear, sequential approach. 

Advantages and disadvantages:

Agile adavantages:

 i)Adaptability to changes in the requirements
 
 ii)Constant customer feedback.

 Disdavantages:
 
 i)Can be chaotic if too many changes are effected.

 ii)Requires constant communication.

 Waterfall Advantages:

 i)Clear structure as the requirements are clear and little to no changes are effected.

 ii)Easy to manage due to clear requirements.

 Disadvantages:

 i)Inflexible thus not good for software that requires numerous changes to requiremnts.

 ii)Difficult to make changes because it takes a linear approach.


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Answer:

Agile: Ideal for projects needing flexibility, like software development e.g. app development.

Waterfall: Best for projects with clear, unchanging requirements e.g. construction projects.


## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Answer:

Methods for ensuring quality assurance:

 i) Regular code reviews
 
 ii)automated testing
 
 iii)Continuous integration

 Why it is important to maintain high standards:

 i) Ensures reliability

 ii)Improves user satisfaction
 

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Answer:

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Answer:

A detailed schedule helps track progress, allocate resources effectively, and anticipate issues or risks. 

Gantt charts visualize timelines and dependencies, enhancing planning and coordination.


## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
Answer:

My software aims to solve specific user problems, such as improving efficiency and reducing costs, making it valuable for my target audience.


## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Answer:

Clearly defining the problem ensures the solution directly addresses user needs thus leading to a more effective and relevant software product.


## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
Answer:

Describe your software as a tool that simplifies or enhances specific tasks, focusing on the benefits it provides to users.


## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Answer:

Unique features like user-friendly interface, integration capabilities, and robust security measures make my software stand out.


## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Answer:

Research data on market demand, growth rates, and trends are available and  helps understand the potential user base and expansion opportunities for my software.

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
Answer:

Analyzing trends helps position your software to meet current demands and anticipate future needs, ensuring relevance and competitiveness.
